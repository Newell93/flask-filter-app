#Make College Affordable Again!

This is an explanation of what my *brilliant* news app can accomplish.

#Main Listing Page

This news app -- affectionately known as **Debty** -- can provide parents of college-ready students with a ranking of schools where students graduate with high-debt or low-debt. The main page allows users to sort colleges in a particular *state* by "Highest Debt" or "Lowest Debt." The filter is the state, and the attribute to sort by is average student debt upon graduation.

#Detail Listing Page

*Debty* gives parents incredible resources on the details page. The school is listed, alongside the city and average debt upon graduation in *$*. It can be sorted by high-debt schools or low-debt schools, but I'm sure many parents would prefer the latter.

#Filters

The filter is the state, and the attribute to sort by is average student debt upon graduation. The app takes state abbreviations as lowercase or uppercase. Choose what works best for you.

Here are three sites that use similar data in a similar fashion:
